ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Delight
I'm a 15-year-old aspiring software developer with a passion for coding. I primarily work with Python and have been diving into game development. Although I'm still learning and exploring different areas in programming, I'm excited to keep growing my skills and see where this journey takes me.

Whether it's building games or just tinkering with code, I'm always looking for new challenges to take on. Let's connect and create something awesome together!
